# DestinyAPI.NET
This is a C# library that provides easy access to Bungie's Destiny API located: https://www.bungie.net/en/Clan/Forum/39966

What you will need:
1. Destiny API Key instructions on how to obtain one can be found here: https://www.bungie.net/en/User/API
2. This is a .NET library (very much in development) so understanding of C# and a solution to work with is required

Current Working Calls:
1. PlayerSearch(String API_KEY)
2. PlayerInfo(String API_KEY)


Documentation incoming, but to get started use those two Classes and each will have 1 method call that will accept a few paramaters.
